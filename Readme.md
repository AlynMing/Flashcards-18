## Flashcards

## Lab 2

### This is an iOS mobile app which is called Flashcards. This is the second lab of this course. In this lab, I added a new screen for the flashcard. After that, I added one button at the bottom to make your flashcard. When you click on the flashcard it will take you to the new screen with the blanks to fill your questions and three options for the correct answer. In the end, I added a two-button one on the top right and one on the top left. The button on the top right is for the user to press when there ready to create their flashcard. The number on the top left is to back to the existing flashcards that are already created by the user.
