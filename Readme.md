## Lab 3

### App Description
In lab 3 I was able to complete the required and optional from lab 3 and lab2. In lab 3 I was able to make my app have multiple flashcards and the user can go back and forth through the flashcards while using the app. Along with that, I was able to store the flashcards to the disk and when the user closes the app and comes back to it will still show the card that was created before closing the app. For the optional part, I was able to put a cross button on the label so that the user can delete the current flashcard and the user can edit the card by clicking on the pencil icon. Last, not the least I was able to have multiple options for the questions for the flashcards.

## Lab 2

### This is an ios mobile app which is called Flashcards. This is the second lab of this course. In this lab, I added a new screen for the flashcard. After that, I added one button at the bottom to make your flashcard. When you click on the flashcard it will take you to the new screen with the blanks to fill your questions and three options for the correct answer. In the end, I added a two-button one on the top right and one on the top left. The button on the top right is for the user to press when there ready to create their flashcard. The number on the top left is to back to the existing flashcards that are already created by the user.

## Lab 1

### This is an iOS mobile app which is called Flashcards. This is the first lab of building the app. In this lab, I did the basics that will lead me to eventually built the app to the advance level. In this lab, I created a New Project using Xcode. I added two flashcards which are two squares. One square has the question and the other one has the answer. When the user clicks on the question that is displayed on the mobile app it hides the question and shows the answer to the user. The way this works is stacking the square that has the answer below the square that has the answer. when the user clicks on the question it uses a property called is hidden and which is set to be true so that it can hide the question and show the answer to the user.
